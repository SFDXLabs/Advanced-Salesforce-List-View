# Advanced-Salesforce-List-View
The standard Salesforce List View component is good, but it is not brilliant. We can view records, add global filters and search for text but that is pretty much it. This project was designed to take this list view and improve on it.

### Current Features
- Enhanced search (search all fields including formulas, picklists, etc... not just pure text)
- Improved filters to allow users to filter on what they want to see there and then
- Pagination and lazy-loading to reduce initial loading times
- Configurable properties making this re-usable in all types of situations
- Conforms to SLDS so looks OOTB on both SLDS v1.0 & v2.0
